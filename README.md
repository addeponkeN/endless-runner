# Instructions

#### - Spawning platforms over a pre-defined area of the screen which scroll past the player at a particular rate

Instead of spawning platforms im placing static platforms with panning textures. This will give the effect that the platforms are moving at a very low cost.

(this is the only blueprint code in the project)
